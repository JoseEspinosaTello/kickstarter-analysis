# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	
Our client Louise has recently completed the fundraising campaign for her play ‘Fever’, and would like to know how well her fundraising campaign fared compared to other fundraising campaigns for theater events between 2009 and 2017. This project will examine the relation between fundraising campaigns based on launch dates and their fundraising goals. The analysis will allow Louise to determine how successful her campaign was and help Louise changes, allowing her maximize the success of future fundraising campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To properly analyze the outcomes based on launch data we created a pivot chart. This pivot chards filters the data by category, which we set to theater as Louise’s play falls under the theater category and it is important that we analyze the relevant category. The chart displays the total count of successful, failed, and canceled fundraising campaigns by the months of the total years. To visualize the data, we selected a line graph as it would allow us to easily see and follow the trends of campaigns per month.
