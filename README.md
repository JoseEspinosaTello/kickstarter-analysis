# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	
Our client Louise has recently completed the fundraising campaign for her play ‘Fever’, and would like to know how well her fundraising campaign fared compared to other fundraising campaigns for theater events between 2009 and 2017. This project will examine the relation between fundraising campaigns based on launch dates and their fundraising goals. The analysis will allow Louise to determine how successful her campaign was and help Louise changes, allowing her maximize the success of future fundraising campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To properly analyze the outcomes based on launch data we created a pivot chart. This pivot chart filters the data by category, which is set to theater as Louise’s play falls under the theater category and it is important that we analyze a relevant category. The chart displays the total count of successful, failed, and canceled fundraising campaigns by the months of the total years. To visualize the data, we selected a line graph as it would allow us to easily see and follow the trends of campaigns per month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The outcomes based on goals was analyzed by counting and summing the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the goal range they fall under. We used play as the category as we wanted to compare Louise’s play fever to the other plays in the dataset. After gathering the total counts, we determined the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the same goal ranges. Once all the data was gathered, we used a line chart as it will allow us to easily visualize the increase and decrease of successful, failed, and canceled percentage rates per their goal range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A challenge that was encountered during the outcomes by launch date was the percentages of success, failed, and canceled campaigns. The current data allows us to see the totals, however, we are working with incomplete data as total amount of successful campaigns does not mean a certain month was more successful than the other. To assist with the analysis, I added columns representing the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. For example. August contains a higher total of successful campaigns compared to October; however, October has a higher success percentage, making it a favorable month to launch a campaign.  


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
